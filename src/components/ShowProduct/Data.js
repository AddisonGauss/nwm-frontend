      "Field Grown Silver Date Palm Grown in South TX. Solitary trunk with long feathery leaf. Does best in well drained soil and full sun. Trunk base is fatter than the P. Dactylifera. Wild Date Palms have more variation in characteristics since they are not grown as clones from the 'pups' of the parent plant. The leaf base can be stripped to expose a diamond pattern similar to the Medjool. ",
